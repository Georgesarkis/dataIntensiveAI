## Code of conduct  
**How we plan to collaborate?**

We plan to work as a unit in this project , we will communicate and work together, using for example pair programming if needed, to fulfill the specified requirements given to us by the product owner(teacher/TAs). 

To organize our work, we will be working using Scrum. We plan on having Sprint planning sessions every Tuesday, directly after the Sprint Review, wherein we will discuss our plans for the upcoming Sprint and produce tasks to fill the Sprint’s trello board with. We have chosen Tuesdays for sprint planning because on Tuesdays we have supervision sesson/lecture in which we can ask question and get help is needed.

Team members are strongly encouraged to work at university. Additionally, we decided to have two meeting as a team every Thursday  and Tuesdays before or after the lecture (time will be decided one day before base on the team memebers preference).

We will further organize our work by using Trello. Each Sprint, which consists of a week, will have its own board. The tasks for each sprint will be in a “To do” column which will be filled out during Sprint planning. Any member can choose the task they want to do and move it to “Doing”. Once they are done, they will move it to “Review” where it will be reviewed and approved by another member before it is moved to the “Done” list.
Every single week **a different team memeber** will update a markdown file located on gitlab with the tasks completed, based on teachers request. 

Lastly, we will have daily stand-ups every day, other than Saturday and Sunday which are free days where no member is required to work, in order to synchronize with the rest of the group on issues and progress. If we are on campus, the stand-up will be face-to-face, otherwise it will be conducted at 6PM on a dedicated Slack channel.

**Our intended way of communication within our group?**

Our main form of communication will be using Slack unless we are all in attendance on campus. We maintain the option to discuss matters on Discord as well should there be a situation where team members are unable to attend physically.

**How will we resolve conflicts?**

There will be a dedicated time slot during the sprint retrospective to bring up issues related to group cohesion in order to solve issues that might cause conflicts within the group setting. Here we should discuss how we can improve communication, planning, work ethics, etc. If a conflict has arisen that has yet to be resolved during the work week this is the time to resolve it once and for all. All group members, whether part of the conflict or not should partake in resolving any issues that have arisen and, in so doing improve our process and our collaboration.

5. George names a moderator who isn’t part of the issue.
6. George talks about the issue initially in the meeting.
